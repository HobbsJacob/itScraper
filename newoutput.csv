Senior Developer;2029952493664646171906305011;programming-development;Thu 18 Apr, 1:59 pm;;Wellington, Wellington;;At Trade Me, developers work in an environment that combines the energy of a startup with the resources of a New Zealand tech success story. We're big enough to get big stuff  done,  and small enough that a single person can have an impact. We're a well-loved household  name,  and work hard to make online experiences that New Zealanders love.  We're looking for a Senior Developer to join our team that owns and engineers the services that sit between our application and infrastructure layers - components like an authentication service, API gateway, and redirection logic between our classic and new-look sites.  We're carefully moving to a service-based architecture, so we're after your mature guidance on how to migrate and mitigate the challenges of multiple interdependent services, and your leadership to mentor and bring your team and the company along for the ride. We've got a whole lot of challenges, but a culture that compels us to say 'yes, let's try it'.  You're perfect for this role if you're ready to take autonomy for your team's work and believe the unit of delivery is the team, not the individual - we don't do heroes here. You make your decisions based upon long-term system health, commercial suitability, and are always thinking about our users' experience.  You've had intermediate or senior developer roles where you've made mistakes and  learnt  from them. You've worked extensively with server-side web frameworks like ASP.NET WebApi, confidently designing and building performant and beautiful APIs, and preferably have worked with cloud technologies. You're also articulate and can build working relationships with a wide range of people to get to the best outcome.  In return, you'll find a culture where people are empowered to do their best and speak their mind with kindness, where normal working hours and home life are valued. We're a modern tech company with modern perks, and we strongly believe a diverse team is a team that makes great choices.
